# toypad-scratch
Extension for ScratchX / Scratch 2 for Raspbian, that allows connecting and interacting with the Lego Dimensions toypad.

# Warning: still in progress
This project is still in progress.  I'll consider it done when it is easy to install as a scratch extension with decent documentation on how to use it.
